        <h2> Major security issues </h2>
        <p> Tik tok has been known to collect as much data as possible from users
            more than Google and Facebook does, which also records everything you say while
            your phone is off since it has an interface where tiktok picks the content
            that YOU like without you knowning and sends it in the FYP (For You Page),
            plus it also shares its information to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)
            which is the current government of China, which is known for banning
            anything from TikTok that mentions anything from Tibet Crackdowns to
            Uyghur Concentration camps. Tiktok has also been known to suppress users who for the algoritm looked "ugly" or disabled people
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> Terrible mental effects </h2>
        <p> With every social media, it is gonna have negative mental effects, so here
            are the terrible mental effects for TikTok. TikTok has a very bad addiction
            to your phone to the point you will have a problem with your attention span
            and could cause some depression after being very addictive to the app where
            you question and ask why this said people are popular, and also causes psychological
            distress which also causes to lose many social behaviors to the point that girls
            developed tics.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <h2> Massive pedophilia problem </h2>
        <p> Since more and more young people join TikTok, the more people who love children
            start to creep up, one of the infamous pedos of the site is TheBudday after he
            was found out grooming children while also sharing CP (Child Porn).
            By the way it takes them forever to ban a pedophile on the site due to
            its cyber safety and its complete laziness.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> Tiktok "challenges"</h2>
        <p> This is very well known by everyone that tiktok has the dangerous and harmful
            challenges in existence, one example is the "blackout" challenge where kids
            hold their breaths until they become unresponsive to the point they actually die.
            Another example is the devious lick challenge where kids will be stealing stuff
            from school without permission and destroy public bathrooms. Another one is
            the "foreigner" challenge where the song Foreigner is played and kids to sexual
            acts and content that exposes them to breasts and other stuff.
